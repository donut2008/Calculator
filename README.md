<h1 style="text-align:center";>Simple calculator</h1>


A small, lightweight, feature-lacking calculator written in C++.

No GUI, only CLI.


Want new features/collab with me? Hit me up on Telegram! @donut2008

(If you're mad that this being simple, remember that this is still in alpha)

I'm still new to C++ programming, so making this was quite a task. I'd definitely like some helpers :)
